        Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'?

        Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Besides, you look good in a dress. Computer, lights up! Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Well, that's certainly good to know. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked.
        
        The unexpected is our normal routine. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. What? We're not at all alike! We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'll alert the crew.
        
       Your shields were failing, sir. They were just sucked into space. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. We have a saboteur aboard. Damage report! We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Ensign Babyface! Shields up! Rrrrred alert! The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. How long can two people talk about nothing? Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. 
       
       In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Travel time to the nearest starbase? and attack the Romulans. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Sorry, Data. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I am your worst nightmare! Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Not if I weaken first. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Computer, belay that order.
